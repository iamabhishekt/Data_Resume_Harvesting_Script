You are analyzing job descriptions to create a focused Dice.com Boolean search query.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The input may contain MULTIPLE job descriptions from different roles/companies
2. If multiple roles are detected, create a query that covers the MOST COMMON or PRIMARY role
3. Focus ONLY on technical skills, tools, technologies, and platforms
4. STRICTLY EXCLUDE all soft skills
5. If one role clearly dominates (appears most), focus the query on that role

Job Descriptions:
{job_description}

TASK:
Analyze the above text and create ONE focused Dice.com Boolean search query that:

1. Identifies the primary/most common role (e.g., "Java Developer", "Python Developer", "SDET", "Appian Developer")
2. Extracts ONLY the TOP 8-12 most important TECHNICAL skills for that role
3. Groups similar technical terms together with OR operators
4. Uses AND operators between different skill groups
5. Includes variations and synonyms for each technical term
6. Uses quotes for multi-word phrases

TECHNICAL SKILLS TO INCLUDE:
- Programming languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, etc.)
- Frameworks and libraries (Spring, React, Angular, etc.)
- Platforms and tools (Appian, ServiceNow, AWS, Azure, etc.)
- Databases (SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle, etc.)
- Development tools (Git, Jenkins, Maven, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Specific technologies (REST APIs, microservices, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Domain-specific technical skills (BPM, ETL, SAIL, RPA, etc.)

SOFT SKILLS TO STRICTLY EXCLUDE:
- Problem-solving, analytical thinking, critical thinking
- Communication, verbal/written communication, stakeholder management
- Teamwork, collaboration, cross-functional teams
- Customer focus, customer-oriented, end-user needs
- Continuous learning, adaptability, self-management
- Leadership, mentorship, guidance
- Time management, task management, prioritization
- Any other behavioral or interpersonal skills

QUERY STRUCTURE:
- Start with role-specific terms: (RoleTitle OR "Role Variation 1" OR "Role Variation 2")
- Follow with core TECHNICAL platform/tool (most important first)
- Add specific technical skills and technologies only
- Include programming languages and frameworks
- Add relevant technical tools

FORMAT EXAMPLE:
("Appian Developer" OR "Appian Architect" OR "Appian Engineer") AND (Appian OR "Appian platform" OR "Appian low-code") AND (SAIL OR "Appian SAIL" OR "Appian UI") AND (BPM OR "Business Process Management" OR "process modeling") AND (RPA OR "Appian RPA" OR automation) AND (Java OR JavaScript OR J2EE) AND (REST OR "REST API" OR "web services") AND (SQL OR database OR "data management")

CONSTRAINTS:
- Maximum 12 skill groups (each group can have multiple OR variations)
- ONLY technical skills - NO soft skills whatsoever
- Focus on verifiable, searchable technical competencies
- Prioritize technical skills mentioned multiple times across descriptions
- If a skill is behavioral/interpersonal, DO NOT include it

Generate ONLY the Dice Boolean query string, nothing else. No explanations, no comments.
